# 🍦 Frosty Delights - Artisanal Ice Cream Website 🍨

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to Frosty Delights - where every scoop tells a story!

## ✨ Key Features That Make This Sweet

- **🎨 Flavor Changer Magic**: Click different ice cream flavors and watch the whole website transform colors!
- **🌈 Parallax Scrolling**: It's like the website version of those fancy layered ice cream cakes - i saw this effect on a random dude website!
- **🔮 Glass Morphism**: Our UI elements look good enough to lick but please don't lick your screen
- **📱 Responsive Goodness**: Looks delicious on phones, tablets, and computers - no melting here, haha!
- **💫 Animated Delights**: Watch ice creams float, buttons bounce, and menus dance like sprinkles on a sundae - kind of easy to do, check the code out

## 🛠️ Tech Ingredients We Used

- **HTML5** - The waffle cone that holds everything together
- **CSS3 with Tailwind** - My special sauce for extra flavor, bruh
- **JavaScript** - The magic sprinkles that make everything interactive
- **Font Awesome** - Cute little icons like the cherry on top
- **Tailwind CSS** - Because we like our styling as smooth as soft serve

## 🚀 Let's Get Scooping!

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser (we recommend Chrome or Firefox but i personally use edge)
2. Play with the flavor buttons - go on, we know you want to!, did this so many times before pushing it here
3. Scroll down like you're exploring the layers of a giant sundae
4. Hover over menu items and watch them float like whipped cream
5. Use the navigation to jump around - it's like having a spoon that teleports you to different flavors

## 🎨 Want to Make It Your Own?

### Content Customization:
- Edit text directly in the HTML (it's easier than making waffle cones!)
- Swap out images in the `images/` folder
- Tweak color themes in the JavaScript - make it match your brand's flavors

### Style Tweaks:
- Play with Tailwind classes (like mixing your own custom flavor)
- Add your secret sauce in `style.css` (no recipe stealing here!)

## 🙏 Sweet Shoutouts
